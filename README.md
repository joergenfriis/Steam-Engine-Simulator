# Steam-Engine-Simulator
Hardware and software that simulates the operation of a 150 Hp Steam Engine on a steam ship

In November 2015 I visited the S/S Alexandra in Flensburg Harbour in Germany. Inspired by the boiler room of this ship I decidet to build a working model of at steam ship engine room at "Det Gamle Vaerft" in Aeroeskoebing in Denmark. Read more about "Det Gamle Vaerft" at www.detgamlevaerft.dk .
The idea is to make a engine room in scale 1:1, as i could have been on at early 1900 stean ship. The Engine room will have no fire in the boiler and no water and steam, but it will simulate the behaviour of the steam ship engine based on how you turn the different operating handles and showel "coal" into the boiler. Coal is replaced with black granite for health reasons.

STATUS
The physical framework has been build, and the sensors and the software are under devellopment.
